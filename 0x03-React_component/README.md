# 0x03-React_component üìñ

## Description üìú

This project involves working with React components, understanding class components, lifecycle methods, event handling, and creating Higher Order Components (HOC). The tasks cover a range of topics to enhance your skills in building efficient and reusable React components.

## Learning Objectivesüõ†Ô∏è

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand when to use a Class or a function to create a component
- Comprehend the lifecycle of a Class component
- Test a React component effectively
- Utilize Jest spies to verify function calls
- Implement Higher Order Components (HOC) for reusability
- Optimize component performance and control rendering

## Project Structure‚öôÔ∏è

The project is organized into multiple tasks, each focusing on specific aspects of React components. Here's an overview of the tasks:

1. **Commence with Class Components**
   - Convert the existing `App` function into a React Class.
   - Ensure tests are still passing.

2. **Lifecycles**
   - Add a lifecycle event to the `App` class, listening for keyboard input.
   - Test the event handling.

3. **Handling Events**
   - Convert the `Notifications` component into a React Class.
   - Create a new event-handling function and test it.

4. **Reusable Comments & Specialization**
   - Implement the `BodySection` component for containment.
   - Create a specialized component `BodySectionWithMarginBottom` with styling.

5. **Use the New Components**
   - Integrate the newly created components into the `App` component.

6. **Test the New Components**
   - Write tests for the newly created components.

7. **Create WithLogging HOC**
   - Develop a Higher Order Component (HOC) for logging mount and unmount events.

8. **Write a Test for the HOC**
   - Create tests for the logging HOC.

9. **Declare a Pure Component**
   - Optimize the `NotificationItem` component as a pure component.

10. **Make Your Own Pure Component**
    - Optimize the `Notifications` component to update only when necessary.

11. **Add a Test**
    - Write tests to ensure the optimized rendering of components.
